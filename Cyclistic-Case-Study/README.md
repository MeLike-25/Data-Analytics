## 📌 Overview

This data analysis project investigates user behavior over a 12-month period (July 2024 – June 2025) for **Cyclistic**, a fictional bike-share company based in Chicago.  
The aim is to uncover how **casual riders** and **annual members** differ in ride patterns, station usage, and trip durations. Insights from this case study were used to support data-driven strategies for increasing annual memberships.
