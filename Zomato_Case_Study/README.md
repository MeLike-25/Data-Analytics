# 🍽️ Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis

## 📝 Overview

This project is part of my Data Analytics portfolio and presents an in-depth analysis of restaurant data sourced from Zomato, a prominent restaurant search and discovery service. The goal of the research was to uncover key insights regarding cuisine popularity, cost, ratings, and their relationships to restaurant location across various cities and countries.

## ❓ Research Questions

The analysis was guided by the following core questions:

1. **🌍 Cuisine Popularity Across Locations:**  
   What are the most popular cuisines served by restaurants, and how does popularity vary across different cities or countries?
   - *Focus:* Cuisine, Location

2. **💸 Cost, Rating, and Cuisine Relationships:**  
   How does the average cost for two people vary based on the restaurant's rating and cuisine type?
   - *Focus:* Cost, Rating, Cuisine

3. **📍 Location and Rating Correlation:**  
   Is there a relationship between a restaurant's location (e.g., Locality, Latitude/Longitude) and its aggregate rating?
   - *Focus:* Location, Rating
